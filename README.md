# Chocolate Chip Cookies (Variation on Nestle Tollhouse)

### Ingredients *(makes ~32 cookies - easy to halve recipe)*

- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 cups semi sweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter
- 1 cup brown sugar (packed)
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375º

2. Melt butter in a medium bowl in microwave for ~1 minute (should be fully liquid and somewhat hot)

3. Add brown & white sugar to butter and mix well with a fork

4. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing each well with the fork

5. Add vanilla if desired (I actually leave it out)

6. In a separate large bowl, combine flour, salt, baking soda and mix

7. Pour butter mixture into the flour bowl, using a spatula to get all of it out, and mix well

8. Add chocolate chips and mix

9. Use a tablespoon to drop dough onto baking sheets in ~1.5in diameter spheres - no need to press them down (I usually do two sheets with 8 cookies at a time)

10. Bake for ~9 minutes. The edges should just turn golden brown, and the middle might look a *little* underdone until they cool. They can be cooked longer if you prefer a sturdier, crispy cookie. Let them rest for ~2 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.
